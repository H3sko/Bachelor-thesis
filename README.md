This thesis explores the development of an Android app using Jetpack Compose to enable cross-platform compatibility for Apple's AirTag tracking on Android devices. Employing Postgres for efficient data management, the application not only enables access to the AirTag location history but also incorporates features such as geofencing. Furthermore, the app incorporates push notifications for timely updates and alerts. The output of this thesis is an application that integrates the mentioned features into the Android ecosystem.
